### 1. Fork this repository

Go to the forked version attached to your Github and clone to desktop. You'll know you're on the right page if it says "forked from" in the upper left corner under your name. **MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR OWN FORK BEFORE ANYTHING**

### 2. Navigate to your homework directory

First open your terminal and navigate to your homework directory using `cd`. If you have the same file structure as we made in class you should be able to open it directly by writing: 

```
cd ~/code/fewd/homework
```

You can also open the folder in finder then drag the file path to your terminal by dragging the folder.
